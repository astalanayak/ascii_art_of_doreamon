# ASCII Art of Doreamon
 This project generates **Doreamon ASCII ART** using **Python**.
 The entire design is created using only:
     - for loops
     - basic logic
     - character patterns
 
 No external libraries
 No image processing 
 Pure Python logic

 ## Project Overview
  
  The purpose of this project is to understand how ASCII art can be built by breaking an image into rows and columns and generating patterns using loops.

This project is ideal for beginners who want to improve their logical thinking in Python.

## Technologies Used 
  
  -Python 3
  -VS Code
  -Git & Github


A simple Python project showcasing logical pattern generation through ASCII art.
